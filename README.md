# Pyth-Man
Simple Pac-man clone originally coded in PASCAL decades ago. Used Deepseek AI to help convert to Python. Got a decent start out of it.

## Installation
Pyth-Man is tested on Windows and MacOS (Mac Mini M4) with **python = 3.12, = 3.13.**.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssrtist/pyth-man.git
```

## Run

```bash
$ cd pyth-man
$ python pyth-man
```
